## Patterns Observed

### New Pattern: Job Seeker Redirect
- When a prospect reveals they're personally job seeking, redirect to CazVid app for job seekers rather than Agency Leads service
- Example: Krish Sharma transitioned from BD prospect to job seeker

### Confirmed Pattern: Position on Hold
- Acknowledge gracefully, offer to help when position reopens
- Include free job posting link for future use

### Confirmed Pattern: New Connection Introductions
- For US Recruiters connecting fresh, introduce CazVid value prop directly
- Ask about active roles to start matching
