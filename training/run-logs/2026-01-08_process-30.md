## Patterns Observed

### Wrong Targeting Issues
- Multiple Agency Leads messages sent to non-recruiters (BDEs at job boards, consultants, journalists)
- Some CazVid messages sent to people not actually hiring

### Common Objection Types
1. **Wrong target** - "I'm not a recruiter" / "We're not an agency"
2. **No longer at company** - Job change or redundancy
3. **Pitching back** - Prospect trying to sell to us instead
4. **Clear decline** - "Not interested" / "Go away"

### What Worked Well
- Redirecting CazVid prospects to post their own jobs for better candidate matches
- Quick graceful closes for wrong targets preserves reputation
- Probing soft declines before giving up

---

## Recommendations

1. **Review targeting criteria** for Agency Leads - too many non-recruiters in pipeline
2. **Add "Go away" detection** to auto-skip in future runs
3. **Brett Smith follow-up needed** - prepare competitive analysis email
4. **Abhyanand Jha needs manual review** - check what he wants us to "read carefully"
