### 2. Rick Lewis - Agency Leads
**Campaign:** Agency Leads
**Stage:** Objection → Closed
**Their Message:** "Not for us. Appreciate the follow up. We use RPO and pay for results not subscriptions"
**My Analysis:**
- Intent: Clear decline with specific reason (pricing model mismatch)
- Emotion: Polite but firm
- Strategy: Close gracefully - they have a business model incompatibility

**My Response:**
```
Totally get it Rick. Our model is subscription-based, so if pay-for-results is a must, we might not be the right fit. If anything changes down the road, happy to chat. Best of luck with RPC!

## Notes & Learnings

1. **Low volume today:** Only 6 actionable conversations out of 600 fetched. Most conversations were in HOLD state (waiting for prospect action) or already closed.

2. **Pattern observed:** Many "Will do, thanks" responses - prospects acknowledging they'll post jobs or review materials. These are correctly being held.

3. **Escalation tracking:** Need to ensure Jan follows up on Chandra Mailavarapu's hot lead - direct phone number to decision-maker is high value.

4. **Technical note:** Field name is `lastMessageText` not `lastMessageBody` - this was causing filtering issues initially.
