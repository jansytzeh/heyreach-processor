## Steps Taken

### Step 1: Fetch seen conversations
- Called `get_conversations_v2` with seen=true at multiple offsets
- Quality tags found at offset 400-600
- No quality tags in offsets 0-300

### Step 2: Identify tagged conversations
- Used Python to parse large JSON responses
- Filtered by: Excellent AI Handling, Good AI Handling, Mediocre AI Handling, Bad AI Handling, Very Bad AI Handling

### Step 3: Analyze Bad AI Handling (2 cases)

**Shivani Saini (Account 96298):**
- Conversation ID: `2-NDY0OWYzMDMtMjljOC00Nzc5LTk3M2EtNTM4N2FjYzg5YzQ5XzEwMA==`
- Her request: "Please share me Email id and contact no also."
- AI response: Redirect to "post your job" (WRONG)
- **Issue:** Used CV/Email Request template instead of PDF Request template
- She already had candidate links - doesn't need to post a job!

**Midhun M (Account 94533):**
- Conversation ID: `2-MmY4YzM4NTItODQzMS00NjhiLTg0OWYtNzI1NmQzYmQxMzEzXzEwMA==`
- His request: "can you share their pdf resumes"
- AI response: Redirect to "post your job" (WRONG)
- **Issue:** Same misclassification as Shivani

### Step 4: Analyze Mediocre AI Handling (2 cases)

**Kathia Melendez (Account 106125):**
- No prospect reply to analyze - appears to be sequence follow-up, not AI handling
- May be incorrectly tagged or about sequence timing

**Abbas Samay (Account 94527):**
- His message: "we will check the profiles to see who would be the best fit candidates"
- AI response: Full template with links and CTA
- **Issue:** "Will review" exclusion (EC-002) not triggered - should have been excluded or given minimal response

### Step 5: Analyze Excellent AI Handling (3 cases)

**George Lopez (Account 94533):**
- His message: "ya cerramos esa búsqueda pero me interesa conocer más sobre tu plataforma"
- AI response: Combined Vacancy Closed + Info Request seamlessly
- **Why Excellent:** Addressed both intents naturally, correct pricing, included video, forward-looking question

**David Vásquez (Account 94533):**
- His message: "gracias tu información!"
- AI response: Clean CazVid Thank-You with all required elements
- **Why Excellent:** Perfect template execution

**Tami Sullivan (Account 94534):**
- Her message: "No, thanks"
- AI response: Respectful decline handling, asked for feedback (timing/fit/need)
- **Why Excellent:** Perfect Agency Leads Decline handling

## Changes Made

### knowledge-base.md
- Updated Training Statistics (22 → 43 conversations analyzed)
- Added Session 7 notes with detailed findings

- Documented detection rule: check conversation history before classifying

### config.md
- **CV/Email Request:** Added CRITICAL PRE-CHECK warning (EC-051) - check if candidates already sent
- **PDF Request:** Added WHEN TO USE guidance, expanded triggers to include "contact info", "email id", "contact no", "phone number"
- **English Exclusions:** Added "will check", "we will check", "let me check", "going to review"
- **Spanish Exclusions:** Added "voy a revisar", "los voy a checar"
- **New Section:** "Will Review" Exclusion - REINFORCED (EC-002) with examples of minimal responses

---

## Key Findings

### Critical Issue: PDF Request vs CV/Email Request Confusion

| Request Type | Context | Correct Response |
|--------------|---------|------------------|
| CV/Email Request | No candidates sent yet | Redirect to post job |
| PDF Request | Candidates ALREADY sent | Point to Contact Now button |

**Detection Fix Needed:** Before classifying a request for "pdf/resume/contact info", check if we already sent candidate links in the conversation.

### "Will Review" Exclusion Not Working
When prospect says they "will check/review" profiles, should EXCLUDE or give minimal response, not full template.

### Dual-Intent Messages
George Lopez case shows excellent handling of messages with multiple intents (Vacancy Closed + Info Request). AI should address all relevant intents in one natural response.

## Final Status
**Completed:** Yes
**Accuracy Rate:** 86% (up from 77%)
