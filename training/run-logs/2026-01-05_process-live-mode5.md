## Notes

1. **Vacancy Closed Response Used:** Successfully applied updated guidelines from training session - sent brief, simple response to Lorena without fabricating context.

2. **CV/Email Request Handled:** Rodrigo S. asked for CVs via email - redirected to platform signup per config.md guidelines.

3. **High Exclusion Rate:** Many conversations had objections ("pero", "but", "however") or exclusion phrases. This is expected behavior - better to skip than send inappropriate responses.

4. **Target Not Met:** Only 14 of 30 target messages sent. Remaining unread conversations didn't match triggers or had exclusions.

## Quality Observations

- All messages followed energy matching principles
- Name capitalization applied correctly
- No fabricated context in any response
- Varied openings used (no consecutive duplicates)
