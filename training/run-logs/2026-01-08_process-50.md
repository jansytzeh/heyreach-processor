- Session was continued from previous context that ran out of tokens
- Large API responses required reading via Bash commands due to token limits
- All declines handled with graceful closures per agent guidelines
- Probed soft declines appropriately before closing

## Recommendations for Next Run

1. Follow up with Karthik Thummala once he provides location requirements for Java+AWS SRE
2. Monitor Johanna Marulanda for job posting completion
3. Washington Vera may need follow-up if he contacts candidates
