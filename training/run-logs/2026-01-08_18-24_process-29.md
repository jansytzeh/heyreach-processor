## Wrong Targeting Issues (Agency Leads)

Many messages sent to non-recruiters:
- Oracle HCM Sales (Kevin Burke)
- Portfolio Manager (Tom Spearman)
- Job boards (Jack Burke at Xref)
- Real estate agents (Joanna)
- Job Placement Specialists (TM Gutierrez)
- Companies selling to us (Qualified Recruiter)

---

## Recommendations

1. **URGENT: Brett Smith email** - Prepare competitive analysis vs Kaspr, LinkedIn Sales Navigator
2. **Review Agency Leads targeting** - Too many wrong targets
3. **Add auto-skip for "stop"/"go away"** messages
4. **Consider holiday blackout dates** - Many Christmas complaints
