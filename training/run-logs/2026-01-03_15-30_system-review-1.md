## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Incorrect Run Log Diagnosis
**File:** `training/run-logs/2026-01-03_14-41_process-1.md`
**Problem:** Incorrectly stated "MCP tools don't work in subagents/skills"
**Fix:** Updated to clarify this was a transient error, not a systemic limitation

### Issue 2: Config Variable Naming Mismatch
**File:** `.claude/commands/update-config.md`
**Problem:** Referenced `MAX_CONVERSATIONS_TO_PROCESS` which doesn't exist
**Fix:** Updated to reference correct variables: `FETCH_LIMIT` and `MAX_MESSAGES_TO_SEND`
