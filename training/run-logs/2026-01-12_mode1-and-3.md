## Jan's Direct Feedback (Session 9)

Jan reviewed 4 specific conversations:

| Conv ID | Lead Name | Issue | Jan's Feedback |
|---------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| 2-Zjg2MzkwMTkt... | - | Missing CTA | "Message lacks a CTA. We should always send activating messages." |
| 2-ZWMxZDUzZjct... | - | Context ignored | "Did not use context. They said yes about customer service, then we asked if they have any job." |
| 2-YzE4ZTdkYTIt... | - | Good example | "No critics, just very good job here" |
| 2-MzdlZTU5YjEt... | Corey Lee | Gave up too soon | "If he really thinks he has everything let's review it in a demo. Make it a game." |

### Key Learnings from Jan

1. **Hierarchy of Goals (CRITICAL):**
   - Priority 1: Get them to POST A JOB
   - Priority 2: Get them to SIGN UP (auto-triggers from posting)
   - Priority 3: Get them to CONTACT CANDIDATES ($50/month)

2. **General Rules:**
   - ALWAYS include a CTA
   - Use video URLs for contact explanation
   - Never give up too soon - offer demo challenge
   - Always use conversation context

3. **Video Tutorial URLs:**
   - Spanish: https://youtu.be/c0E8sfSFqeM
   - English: https://youtu.be/mldU26l91ZA
