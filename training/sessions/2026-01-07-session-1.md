# Training Session - 2026-01-07

## Summary
**Part 1 (Mode 1):** Reviewed 12 quality-tagged conversations. Discovered BPO confusion (EC-046) and location objection after rejection (EC-047).

**Part 2 (Mode 3):** Analyzed 10 prospect reactions. Discovered false video profile claim (EC-048), wrong language detection (EC-049), and created language switch response type (EC-050).

## Key Learnings

1. **BPO vs Staffing Agency Confusion (CRITICAL)**
   - AI incorrectly told a BPO company that Agency Leads helps them
   - BPO companies SELL workers, they don't BUY candidates
   - Agency Leads is for staffing agencies that PLACE candidates at client companies
   - Added EC-046 with detection phrases

2. **Location Objection After Rejection**
   - When prospects say "no cumplen" (don't meet requirements), we shouldn't push platform signup
   - Should probe first: "What location do you need?"
   - Added EC-047 to differentiate from standard location objection (EC-004)

3. **Energy Matching Still Needs Work**
   - José Vilches (!!!) got subdued response
   - Olga (very short message) got very long response
   - Need stricter length matching guidelines

4. **Short Thank-You Handling Works**
   - Paul Saez "Gracias" → AI "Gracias a ti! Que te parecieron los perfiles?"
   - Perfect EC-045 application

## Changes Made
- [x] Updated edge-cases.md (added EC-046, EC-047)
- [x] Updated config.md (added BPO detection to English exclusions)
- [x] Updated knowledge-base.md (version 2.2.0, session notes)
- [x] Created run log: 2026-01-07_review-tagged-1.md

## Part 2: Mode 3 - Analyze Prospect Reactions

### Key Learnings (Mode 3)

5. **False Video Profile Claim (CRITICAL)**
   - AI claimed "Each candidate has a video profile" - THIS IS FALSE
   - Not all candidates have video profiles
   - Added EC-048 to prevent this claim

6. **Wrong Language Detection (CRITICAL)**
   - Jordan Dahlquist (Cyprus) received Spanish, replied in Greek
   - System checked candidate locations instead of prospect location
   - Added EC-049 with country-to-language mapping

7. **Language Switch Request (NEW RESPONSE TYPE)**
   - Dhanshree Gade: "Can we communicate in English?"
   - This is NOT a rejection - they're still interested!
   - Added EC-050 and new response guidelines

### Prospect Reaction Summary

| Category | Count | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Positive | 3 | Silpa (wants to call!), Valeria (enthusiastic), Joy (wants more) |
| Neutral | 3 | Faustino, Priscila, Tharik |
| Decline | 2 | Saffron, Luke (both Agency Leads) |
| Language Issue | 2 | Dhanshree (India), Jordan (Cyprus) |

### Changes Made (Mode 3)
- [x] Added EC-048, EC-049, EC-050 to edge-cases.md
- [x] Added Language Switch Request response type to config.md
- [x] Updated knowledge-base.md (version 2.3.0, Session 6)
- [x] Created run log: 2026-01-07_analyze-reactions-1.md
- [x] Added energy matching rules to config.md (from Part 1 follow-up)

## Next Steps
- [x] ~~Review energy matching guidelines~~ (DONE - added word count rules to config.md)
- [ ] Monitor for future BPO detection cases to validate EC-046
- [ ] Run Mode 9 (Outcome Review) to track conversion patterns
- [ ] Fix language detection to check prospect location first (requires system change)
- [ ] Monitor for more language switch requests to validate EC-050
