## Mode

## Summary
Reviewed all conversations tagged with AI handling quality tags. Found 9 conversations, all tagged as "Good AI Handling". No Bad or Mediocre cases were found in this batch of 25 seen conversations.

## Conversations Reviewed

| Lead | Language | Trigger Message | Verdict |
|------|----------|-----------------|---------|
| Cristian Albornoz | ES | "hola! muchas gracias!!!!!!" | Enthusiasm handled |
| Johanna Porras | ES | "Muchas gracias" | Simple trigger |
| Soumay Mathur | EN | "Thanks for sharing them" | Correct language |
| Mónica Rojas | ES | "Hola, gracias!" | Prefix handled |
| Vicente Gonzalez | ES | "Gracias, Wesley" | Used lead's name |
| Claudia Villalobos | ES | "Hola Juan, gracias!" | Used lead's name |
| Pablo Valdés | ES | "Muchas gracias John!" | Used lead's name |
| Vineela Naidu | EN | "Okay, thank you" | Prefix handled |
| Oscar Peñate | ES | "muchas gracias por la referencia" | Context phrase OK |

## Key Learnings

1. **Name personalization is working correctly** - When leads address the sender by name (e.g., "Gracias, Wesley"), AI correctly uses the lead's name in the response, not the sender's.

2. **Language detection is accurate** - All 9 conversations correctly identified as Spanish (7) or English (2).

3. **Prefix handling works** - Greetings like "Hola" or "Okay" before thank-you phrases don't interfere with detection.

4. **Enthusiasm doesn't break detection** - Multiple exclamation marks (!!!!!!) are handled gracefully.

5. **Context phrases are acceptable** - Additional context like "por la referencia" or "for sharing them" after thank-you doesn't block the trigger.
