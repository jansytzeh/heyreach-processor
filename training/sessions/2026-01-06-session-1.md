# Training Session - 2026-01-06

## Summary
Five major improvements:
1. Refined Location Objection to redirect to platform instead of dead-end question
2. Added PDF Request response type → then REVISED to use existing candidate links
3. Added Short/Ambiguous Thank-You 2-step approach (probe first, then pitch)
4. Fixed PDF Request to point to "Contact Now" button instead of posting new job
5. Added LinkedIn Profile Request response type (same pattern as PDF Request)

## Key Learnings
1. Location objections should be treated like CV/Email requests - redirect to platform
2. The old response ("Would you like me to send candidates?") was a dead-end question
3. Use `[location]` placeholder instead of `[city]` to cover countries, regions, states, etc.
4. Short ambiguous messages need probing first - don't dump full templates on 4-word messages
5. "Te agradezco" in Latin America can mean thanks OR polite decline - verify intent first
6. Chris Voss: Mirror their exact words, match their energy, use calibrated questions
7. **PDF Request insight:** We already sent candidate links - they can access PDFs via "Contact Now" button, no need to make them post a new job
8. **LinkedIn Profile Request:** Same pattern as PDF - point to "Contact Now" button on candidate pages

## Problem Conversation
- **Lead:** Mohanad Emad
- **Issue:** AI responded with passive question instead of platform redirect
- **Old response:** "Would you like me to send some candidates from Egypt directly to you?"
- **New approach:** Direct to posting job on CazVid with promise of email delivery

## Changes Made
- [x] Updated config.md - Location Objection section
  - Changed goal from "offer to find candidates" to "redirect to platform"
  - Updated required elements to include platform redirect + email promise
  - Changed examples to use new template
  - Updated placeholder from `[city]` to `[location]`
  - Updated placeholder from `[Name]` to `[First Name]`
- [x] Updated Already Processed Detection pattern
  - Old: "tenemos candidatos en" OR "we have candidates in"
  - New: "Post your job on CazVid" OR "Publica tu vacante en CazVid"

## New Template

**English:**
```
No problem at all, [First Name]! We have candidates in [location].

Post your job on CazVid and we'll send candidates from [location] directly to your email.

Post for free here: [link]
```

**Spanish:**
```
¡Sin problema, [First Name]! Tenemos candidatos en [location].

Publica tu vacante en CazVid y te enviaremos candidatos de [location] directamente a tu correo.

## Change 2: PDF Request Response Type (REVISED)

### Initial Problem
No template existed for when prospects ask for candidates in PDF format.

### First Attempt (Wrong)
Redirected to posting a new job on CazVid - but this was an extra step they didn't need.

### Problem Conversation (Midhun M)
- **Message:** "can you share their pdf resumes"
- **Wrong AI response:** "If you post your job on CazVid, I can send the candidate resumes directly through the platform."
- **Issue:** We already sent candidate page links - they can access PDFs directly from there!

### Revised Solution
Point them to the candidate pages we ALREADY sent:
- Click "Contact Now" button on candidate pages
- Download PDFs directly
- Include video tutorial

### New Template (Final - Revised)

**English:**
```
Absolutely, [First Name]! You can access the PDF resumes directly through the CazVid platform.

Just select the "Contact Now" button on the candidate pages I sent you and you can download their PDFs directly.

Here's a quick video to show you how: [video]
```

**Spanish:**
```
¡Claro que sí, [First Name]! Puedes acceder a los PDFs directamente a través de la plataforma CazVid.

Solo selecciona el botón "Contactar Ahora" en las páginas de los candidatos que te envié y podrás descargar sus PDFs directamente.

Aquí te dejo un video rápido que te muestra cómo: [video]
```

### Key Design Decisions
- They already have candidate links - no extra steps needed
- "Contact Now" button is the key action
- Video tutorial shows exactly how
- Simple and direct

## Change 3: Mode 1 Review - Short/Ambiguous Thank-You (2-Step Approach)

### Problem Conversation
- **Lead:** Brisa Bonetti
- **Tag:** Mediocre AI Handling
- **Message:** "Hola John, te agradezco!"

### Why It Was Mediocre
1. **Energy mismatch:** AI dumped 50+ words on a 4-word message
2. **Fabricated context:** AI said "te sirvan los perfiles" but she never said that
3. **Ambiguous trigger:** "Te agradezco" in Latin America can mean thanks OR "I'm good"
4. **Violated Core Principles:** #6 (mirroring) and new #8 (match brevity)

### Solution: 2-Step Approach
For short ambiguous thank-yous (< 15 words, no enthusiasm markers):

**Step 1 - Probe first (match their brevity):**
```
¡Gracias a ti! ¿Qué te parecieron los perfiles?
```

**Step 2 - ONLY if they respond positively:** Send full template with links.

### Changes Made
- [x] Added EC-045 to edge-cases.md
- [x] Added Core Principle #8: "Match their brevity"
- [x] Added Short/Ambiguous variant to CazVid Thank-You (Spanish)
- [x] Added Short/Ambiguous variant to CazVid Thank-You (English)

### Key Learning: Chris Voss Mirroring
- Mirror their exact words, don't fabricate
- Match their energy level
- Use calibrated "What" questions to discover intent

## Change 4: LinkedIn Profile Request Response Type

### Problem Conversation (Navniet Siviyya)
- **Message:** "could you give me their valid linkedin account so i can verify this profiles."
- **Wrong AI response:** Explained that candidates use CazVid instead of LinkedIn profiles
- **Issue:** They CAN access LinkedIn profiles through the platform!

### Solution
Same pattern as PDF Request - point them to candidate pages:
- Click "Contact Now" button on candidate pages
- Access LinkedIn profiles directly
- Include video tutorial

### New Template

**English:**
```
Absolutely, [First Name]! You can access their LinkedIn profiles directly through the CazVid platform.

Just select the "Contact Now" button on the candidate pages I sent you and you can view their LinkedIn profiles directly.

Here's a quick video to show you how: [video]
```

**Spanish:**
```
¡Claro que sí, [First Name]! Puedes acceder a sus perfiles de LinkedIn directamente a través de la plataforma CazVid.

Solo selecciona el botón "Contactar Ahora" en las páginas de los candidatos que te envié y podrás ver sus perfiles de LinkedIn directamente.

Aquí te dejo un video rápido que te muestra cómo: [video]
```

## Other Tagged Conversations Reviewed

| Lead | Tag | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Marlenny | Excellent | Good energy matching, mirrored her words "me sirve" |
| Tharik | Mediocre | Used old Location Objection template (already fixed by Change 1) |
| Brisa | Mediocre | Fixed by Change 3 |

---

## Next Steps
- Monitor Location Objection, PDF Request, LinkedIn Profile Request, and Short/Ambiguous responses for quality
- Tag as Good/Mediocre/Bad AI Handling for future review
- Watch for conversion improvement (probe first → more qualified leads posting jobs)
- **Pattern identified:** PDF Request and LinkedIn Profile Request follow same template structure - "Contact Now" button is the universal answer for accessing candidate info
